Force Session Close

While my team was building an extranet application for a client we came accross a slightly strange requirement from their InfoSec Audit team. 

They want to forcably log users out who have been active on the site for longer than 12 hours making them re-authenticate. 

This is not particularly user friendly - but audit teams tend to not be particulary negoitable about ISO27000 requirements. 

I had a look around and couldn't find anything which did specifically this - so I took some time to write my first drupal module. 

If this is helpful then great. Pull requests/patches are gratefully received.
